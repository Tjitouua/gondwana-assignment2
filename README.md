 To run the assignment:  
1. Open two terminals  
2. In the first terminal run `npm install` then `npm run dev`  
3. Go to the `api` folder  
4. Run: `cd api` then `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`  
5. The API is working fine locally, but with Codespace it is not returning any data,  
   probably it might be that Gondwana API doesn't want to connect with Codespace
